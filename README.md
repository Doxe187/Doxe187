## Hi there 👋

I'm **Janis**, a software engineer based in Switzerland 🇨🇭.

I love building tools and applications that solve real problems — mostly because I'm too lazy to do repetitive work myself 😁.  
I'm always learning new technologies and especially enjoy exploring the possibilities of AI. It helps me improve my workflow, automate boring tasks, and stay efficient.

I'm a big fan of **open-source** and spend a lot of time in the terminal with my custom **Neovim** setup. I don’t hate the mouse... but I try to avoid using it as much as possible.

### 🧰 Tech Stack
- **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**
- Terminal-driven development with **Neovim**
- Always experimenting with new tools and frameworks

### 🛵 Current Projects
- Building my own **moped shop** (because I really love “Töffli”)
- Organizing a **moped event** for next spring
